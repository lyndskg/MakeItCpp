# MakeItCpp

DEFAULT MAKEFILE TEMPLATE, INCLUDE FUCKING LIBCURL INTO MAKEFILE 
Generally for C++?? Tweak as needed

MakeItCpp is an innovative coding project that aims to provide default Makefile templates for C++ programmers. The project offers a collection of pre-configured Makefile templates that enable C++ developers to quickly set up their build environment and compile C++ projects with ease. MakeItCpp simplifies the process of creating and managing Makefiles, saving developers valuable time and effort in the project setup phase.

## Key Features:
1. Default Makefile Templates: MakeItCpp offers a variety of default Makefile templates, each tailored to different project structures and configurations.
2. Customization Options: Developers can customize the Makefile templates according to their specific project requirements and preferences.
3. C++ Project Management: MakeItCpp assists in managing C++ projects by handling the compilation, linking, and build process.
4. Dependency Tracking: The Makefile templates include dependency tracking to avoid unnecessary recompilations and optimize build times.
5. Platform Agnostic: MakeItCpp provides templates that are platform agnostic, ensuring compatibility across different operating systems.
6. Continuous Updates: The project will be maintained with continuous updates, incorporating best practices and improvements.


## Best Coding Languages:

Python is the best coding language for this project. Python allows for easy file manipulation and template generation, making it ideal for creating and customizing Makefile templates.


## Basic Workflow:
1. Template Collection: Compile a collection of default Makefile templates, each designed for different types of C++ projects (e.g., single file, multi-file, libraries).
2. User Input: Developers can input their project specifications, such as source files, library dependencies, compilation flags, and output directories.
3. Template Customization: MakeItCpp will generate the Makefile based on the selected template and the user's input, offering customization options as needed.
4. Dependency Tracking: The Makefile templates will include dependency tracking to identify and build only the necessary components during the compilation process.
5. Cross-Platform Support: Ensure that the Makefile templates are compatible with popular operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) to support various developer environments.
6. Continuous Updates: Maintain the project with regular updates to incorporate new C++ features and improve template efficiency based on user feedback.


## Basic I/O Details:

MakeItCpp will provide a command-line interface (CLI) or a simple web-based form where developers can input their project specifications and preferences.


After receiving the user's input, the program will generate a customized Makefile based on the selected template and project settings. The generated Makefile will be saved in the project directory or the user-specified output location.

Developers can integrate the generated Makefile into their C++ projects to streamline the build process and manage dependencies efficiently. The project will also include documentation and usage guidelines to help developers get started with MakeItCpp templates.
